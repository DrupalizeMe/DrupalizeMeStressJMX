## Drupal + JMeter

This is an example test suite demonstrating how to test Drupal with Apache JMeter. It was setup to test the Drupalize.Me site but can be modified to fit your own needs.

This was mostly used to generate reports for this blog post https://drupalize.me/blog/201610/load-testing-our-site-pantheon
